TITLE = Scrim Multi o2 v2
DESCRIPTION = V2 includes the launcher as well as the original Multi-Scrim patch.<br/>Now Messaging section plays nice w/ avatar on left patch.<br/>New font styles for Email looks better w/ darker color scrims.<br/><br/>Special Thanks to DrSuSE for the font/color revisions.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 1.4<br/>I have set up a dropbox for scrims...Pm me or email me w/ your email address and ill send you an invite to add or use premade scrims.<br/>Hopefully this will cut down on misspelled or incorrect extensions.<br/><br/>2sslow@gmail.com<br/>This one works but I had to remove the video player section until i get time to figure out what Palm has done there.Let me first say I am making this for the masses that are not comfortable using command line to change certain backgrounds.<br/><br/>I want to make it easier to customize the Pre without having to be a computer person to do it.<br/><br/>This Patch creates a customizable background for 9 native Pre apps!<br/><br/>Warning Please remove All Previous Scrim Patches Before Using!<br/><br/>1)Install using Preware<br/>2)In USB mode create a folder named 'scrims' without the quotes<br/>3)Files MUST be named correctly as follows. (lower case!):<br/>browser-scrim.png<br/>contacts-scrim.png<br/>email-scrim.png<br/>messaging-scrim.png<br/>music-player-scrim.png<br/>notes-scrim.png<br/>phone-scrim.png<br/>photos-scrim.png<br/>launcher-scrim.png<br/>*video-player-scrim.png (not available w/ 1.4)<br/><br/>All backgrounds will be defaulted to a black background with a white font. If you don't create a .png for a specific app then the patch will default to the black/white background.<br/><br/>I do not use themes so I cannot and will not test this patch w/ a theme installed! if you use a theme use this at your own risk.<br/><br/>There is no danger installing this patch! you cant BRICK (no such thing) your Pre by installing this patch! If there is a problem it simply will fail during install and revert to your previous configuration!<br/><br/>I have tested this on my own Pre and the emulator and appears to work flawlessly.<br/><br/>To remove this patch either remove it through Preware or run EPR, The scrims folder will remain no matter if you run EPR or run the DR.
